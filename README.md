# YouTube Clone

This project is a YouTube clone developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application aims to replicate essential features of YouTube, such as:

- **Video Uploading**: Users can upload and manage their videos.
- **Video Streaming**: Stream videos with adaptive quality and responsive playback.
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in/sign-up functionality with user profile management.
- **Comments and Likes**: Users can interact with videos through comments and likes.
- **Search and Recommendations**: Search for videos and receive personalized recommendations.

This project serves as a learning tool for implementing a full-stack application and understanding the integration of front-end and back-end technologies.
